Each season has an \u201cearly\u201d and a \u201clate\u201d track to accommodate academic calendar differences at different schools.","Two months before the season start, X-Culture sends out a call for participants. Instructors interested in making X-Culture part of their IB course apply online.","Within a few days after applying, instructors receive a decision on their application. X-Culture is open to all qualified instructors/students, but the enrollment is competitive and not all applications are approved.","Successful applicants receive all materials several weeks prior to the start of the X-Culture project, including instructions and guidelines for students and instructors, training materials and other information.","Before the project start, instructors and students are required to review X-Culture training materials and take a readiness test. The test ensures that all participants are sufficiently familiar with how X-Culture works, the task the teams will be working on, deadlines, available communication tools, and other project-related issues. Most students pass the test, but a few fail and are asked to review the training materials more carefully and retake the test.","Students who successfully pass the readiness test are randomly assigned to global virtual teams (typically 7 students, all from different countries) and receive personal emails on the first day of the project with the names and contacts of their team members.","Students work in global virtual teams over a 2-month period. During this time, they have to meet weekly deadlines. Three days before each deadline, each student receives a personal email with a deadline reminder and a personalized link to an online progress report form. The information is aggregated and the instructors receive detailed weekly reports on performance of each of their students. The students also receive weekly feedback, suggestions and updates on how their teams are doing compared to other teams.","Although most of the coordination, communication, and performance monitoring are managed centrally by X-Culture, instructors regularly communicate with their students and provide coaching and guidance. Instructors normally devote at least a few minutes each lecture to discuss student progress, address concerns and answer questions.","At the end of the project, student teams submit their international business proposals viaTurnItIn, an online platform that checks submissions for plagiarism. The students also complete an online post-project survey that include-peer evaluations.","Once received, the team reports are evaluated by the instructors using standardized rubrics. Normally, each instructor evaluates the reports from the teams that had his/her students in them. Since every student is on a different team, this means that normally an instructors have to evaluate as many reports as there are students in his/her course, and that each student report is independently evaluated by seven instructors.","The instructor evaluations of the team reports are then aggregated and used to select the best student teams.","All students receive X-Culture Global Collaboration Experience Certificates and the members of the best teams receive Best Team awards ($1,000 per team, contingent upon funding availability).","During the project, instructors receive rich multi-source longitudinal data on performance of their students, including performance on the pre-project readiness test, ability to meet weekly deadlines, brief weekly and detailed post-project peer evaluations, and multi-dimensional evaluation of the quality of the team reports. Instructors are free to use this information as they see fit for determining their students\u2019 course grades/marks.","At the end of each X-Culture season, instructors and students are invited to the X-Culture Symposium (e.g., the most recent X-Culture Symposium hosted by Mercedes-Benz). Subject to funding availability, members of the best student teams may receive travel stipends to attend the meeting.","The data collected by X-Culture are used to study global virtual teams, international collaboration, experiential learning, and related issues.

Typically, the teams are comprised of 6-8 trainees, each coming from a different country.","The teams will be presented with an international business challenge and have about two months to develop a solution.","There will be weekly deadlines that the teams have to meet. Each team member will receive a personal email with a link to the weekly progress update survey and will have to report if the team has completed that week\u2019s task.","At the end of the project, the teams will present their challenge solutions in a form of team reports. The reports will be evaluated by 6-7 independent experts.","Based on the expert evaluations, best teams will be awarded the X-Culture Best Team Awards.","Additionally, individual performance records and peer evaluations will be used to select each season\u2019s Best Student Award recipients."],G=[{title:"ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING",text:"X-Culture improves cultural intelligence, international and virtual collaboration competencies, problem solving skills, and interest in cross-cultural interactions."},{title:"IMPROVE TEACHING EVALUATIONS",text:"Students recognize the value of X-Culture.

Each research project is different and the different approaches may work best for different research teams.","As projects progress, changes in research team composition, workload distribution, and relative contributions of the different team members change. We act in good faith, give credit to those who deserve it and don\u2019t claim credit when it is not deserved."],me=["Researchers, members of the X-Culture team or external, have certain preferences and need autonomy with respect to how they conduct their study, how the workload is distributed, and who is on their co-author team.","Researchers engage in research not only because they are genuinely interested in answering their research questions, but also because this is part of their job, and their research productivity, to a large extent, determines their job and promotion options and recognition in the field.","Researchers expect that their investment in a particular study will be properly recognized, including in a form of authorship of any resulting publications and presentations.","We also recognized that the authorship order matters, as well as that the general perception still is that the greater the number of co-authors, the less credit goes to the individual co-authors.","Researchers want protection of their intellectual property.","Thus, Researchers, internal or external to the X-Culture team, likely want to use X-Culture data as they see fit, receive help from the X-Culture team with paper development if further expertise is needed but not to be bothered otherwise, be listed as the first, and possibly sole author of any resulting publication, and be assured that the research ideas they put forth will not be \u201cstolen\u201d by others.","As much as we can, we will honor these wishes, not only for ethical reasons, but also because this is a foundation for interest and motivation to work with the X-Culture team. Nothing kills motivation more than free-riding and unfair treatment."],he=["Many members of the X-Culture team invest immense amounts of time and effort into making the X-Culture project possible, including in collecting the data. They too want their input to be recognized, both because it feels good to be recognized, but also because they too live in a publish-or-perish world.","Every data point in the X-Culture dataset is there because someone thought it could be used in future research, and took the time to design the survey, send out the invites and reminders, collect the data, build the database, prepare the supporting code books and other documentation, all while following proper data collection and management and research ethics guidelines. That is hundreds and even thousands of hours of work invested by some of the researchers on the X-Culture admin team to collect and make these data available for you.","There are many talented and experienced researchers on the X-Culture team who can make valuable contributions to many studies conducted based on the X-Culture data. Many of them will be genuinely interested and, most importantly, have the necessary skills and knowledge to make a truly valuable and meaningful contribution to a study proposed by external researchers. If not given an opportunity to participate, not only that may lead to reduced morale and motivation on our team, but also to beliefs, often justifiable, that the data should not be shared externally as the research ideas and expertise to conduct the study in question has been on the X-Culture team all along, we just didn\u2019t have the time to get it yet."],pe=["We ask for a study description first to determine that the idea is indeed new and nobody is working on the same study already. This is necessary to ensure that we do not end up with multiple people working on the same paper, one publishing the paper earlier thereby making it impossible for the others to submit their work as it will no longer be original.","We maintain a list of ongoing studies so that researchers interested in starting a new study could quickly check if their idea is indeed new.","Once a new study proposal is approved, the study description will be added to the list, thereby allowing the researcher to claim lead authorship on the project.","Once it is determined the study idea is new and the study is tentatively approved, we share the proposal with the X-Culture network. On the one hand, we want to make certain all people who are helping with the data collection are aware of how the data are used and can express their concerns and suggestions, if any.","On the other hand, if the Author of the new study feels he/she may need help with conducting the study, we encourage that the study proposal contains a general list of functions or task that must be performed to complete the study, preferably with notes as to what functions or tasks the researcher who is submitting the proposal has covered and where further help may be needed.","In response, members of the X-Culture team who have the necessary expertise and time to perform those functions can apply to co-author the study.","It is up to the researcher(s) who submit the study proposal to decide how to handle those applications: all or none of the applications can be accepted. That is, the researcher(s) who initiated the study can choose to work as the sole author and reject all applications for co-authorship, or if the applicant(s) seem to be able to make a valuable contribution to the proposed paper, they may be invited as co-authors.","It is recommended that if there is interest among the X-Culture team members to co-author the study, and the applicants have the necessary expertise, they be allowed to join the co-author team. The reason is not because we want a free ride, but because many members of the X-Culture team are indeed expert researchers, they know the X-Culture data and research design like no one else, have very strong work ethics and are likely to make a valuable and meaningful contribution and improve the quality of the final product.","The X-Culture project is uniquely positioned to provide peer-to-peer learning and networking opportunities and we encourage mentorship and expertise sharing. While it is generally expected that co-authors are experts in the area of the study, when feasible, less experienced colleagues can be invited to perform routine task that do not require special skills or knowledge."],ge=["To (co)author a paper, one can either propose a new paper (and lead-author it), or respond to a call for co-authors from other researchers.","Signing up to co-author a project does not guarantee co-authorship on any of the resulting publications.","The lead author has the right to reject applications if there is a doubt the applicant can make a truly meaningful contribution to the paper.","Only researchers who actively participate in development of a particular paper can be co-authors of that paper.","Limited input such as providing occasional advice or reading the paper draft and providing comments on it is not sufficient to be listed as a co-author of the paper.","However, researchers who provide substantial input with theory development, data preparation and management for this particular study, data analysis, paper write up, or provide valuable insights and help otherwise are expected to be listed as co-authors.","Generally, the researcher who submits the original proposal for a paper gets to be the first author, provided that the researcher takes on the leading role, coordinates efforts of the co-author team, and does otherwise most of the work or makes the most significant contribution to the study. Other lead-author arrangements are possible, and the decision is up to the co-authors of that particular paper.","The co-authors will be listed in the order of their individual contributions or alphabetically if the contribution level is approximately equal.","Unless otherwise agreed by the team of co-authors, it is the right and responsibility of the lead author to coordinate task and workload distribution among the participating co-authors, make certain that the tasks are completed on schedule, facilitate discussion among the members of the co-author team, and make other important decisions related to coordination and management of paper development.","The lead author must consult the co-authors on all important issues, such as adding or excluding co-authors, author order, and the like, but in the interest of efficiency, the lead author can make unilateral decisions about routine issues such as workload distribution and the like.","While these decisions are often not easy, in the interest of the success of the research efforts of the co-author team, it is the obligation of the lead author to not only keep track of performance of the co-authors, but also to initiate exclusion from the co-author team of the individuals who are not meeting the input expectations."],fe=["As long as a research proposal for a study that uses X-Culture data has been approved, any researchers interested in conducting the same or similar studies can only work in collaboration with the original research team. The original research team and any new researchers are expected to work together to ensure that intellectual rights of the researcher(s) who originally came up with the idea are protected, as well as that all researchers who can make a valuable contribution to the study are given a chance.","To ensure that no research ideas are dropped due to inability of the lead author or co-author team to complete the study, the X-Culture team, and not individual internal or external researchers, retains ownership of any study or paper being developed using X-Culture data, from the moment the research proposal is approved. That means that in the cases when a researcher or a team of researchers suggest a study idea and start working on a paper, but for any reason cannot complete it in a reasonable time, the X-Culture team has the right to recompose the co-author team, finish the study and publish the paper. The new co-author team may not contain any or all of the original co-authors, including the researcher who originally came with the idea for the study.","Given the sensitivity of the issue, any decisions of this nature must be made in good faith and as much as possible in consultation with the members of the X-Culture team. As long as there is evidence that the original co-author team is actively working on the study, the team should be given no less than two years to produce the first complete draft of the paper, and no less than another two years to try to publish the paper.","However, if there is evidence that the co-author team is making no progress on the study, inquiry into the feasibility of allowing a new team of researchers to work on it is recommended even if the team has been working on the study for less than two years. The original members of the co-author team should be encouraged and allowed to continue working on the study, provided they are interested and capable of making a contribution to the study.","If it is determined that the original co-author team is incapable of publishing the study in a reasonable amount time and a new co-author team starts working on the study, the original and new co-authors are expected to work out the authorship issues so that the final list of co-authors on any resulting publications reflects individual contributions of all involved parties."],we=["While we believe in open data sharing, we must impose certain restrictions on ownership and sharing of our data.","X-Culture is team effort and it is our obligation to ensure that the X-Culture team members who directly contribute to data collection are given priority to develop papers based on the data. Also, we must protect intellectual rights of the internal and external researchers who approach us first with their research ideas. Finally, we must ensure that data are handled in accordance with the Research Ethics guidelines.","Therefore, the X-Culture team remains the sole owner and manager of the X-Culture data and retains the right to deny access to data or revoke access to the data at any time.","The data will be shared only after the research proposal is reviewed and approved by the X-Culture team and only a portion of the data pertaining to a given study will be shared with the research team.","When a new paper development proposal is approved and the author(s) obtained the data, they can only use the data for developing the approved paper and not use or share the data otherwise.","The X-Culture data can only be used for studies or purposes approved in advance and in writing by the X-Culture admin.","That is: if you want to use the X-Culture data, you must send in a study/paper proposal.
